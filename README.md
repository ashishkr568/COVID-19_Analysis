# COVID-19 Analysis
This reposotory is dedicated to the analysis for the spread of Coronavirus. The data used for analysis is provided by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Thanks to the team for making it publicly available. Below is the link to their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

**I have performed all analysis on country level and as there was huge fluctuation in data I have used weekly sum for this analysis.**

Below is the list of analysis, I have tried on the provided data:

1. Weekly registered case
2. How many countries are affected by it
3. How is the world recovering
4. How many countries have atleast 1 recovered cases
5. How many people are loosing life each week
6. How many countries have atleast 1 deaths
7. What is the mortality rate if we only consider Closed cases?
8. Overall status

I will keep on updating this notebook with new visualizations and appent the above list.
